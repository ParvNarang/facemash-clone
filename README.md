# facemash

Made a FaceMash clone using the ELO rating system(algorithm used to rank chess players), which currently works locally. 
It takes the base rating of players as an input in the form of a text file and it maps those values in an array. These values are used to calculate the expectation winning value of players, which gets updated as the game progresses.
These players are then ranked accordingly using the updated rating of each player.
